# One hardware project a year

1. Hexapod robot - Control an actual hexapod via a web application - 2020
2. A basic robot arm workshop - 2021
3. Acrobatic Quadrotor project - 2022
4. 3d printer - 2023
    - print mechanisms
    - Lego to dc motor, servo, and stepper motor adapter

## The basic robot arm workshop

1. Servo calibration and the arduino ide
2. breadboarding, potentiometer, buttons, leds to control robot arm
    - try to write "hello" and your name with potentiometers
    - try to stack cups in a pyramid
3. Basic linear algebra and forward kinematics
4. Basic inverse kinematics
5. Program and use inverse kinematics to 
   - Write "hello" and your name
   - Stack cups in a pyramid
6. Use joysticks and buttons to control the robot arm (inverse kinematics code) 

### Prerequisites

1. Some experience with coding in any language
2. Familiarity with highschool trigonometry

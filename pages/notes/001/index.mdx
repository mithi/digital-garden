This is a normal paragraph. The next few words and sentences should not be important. It could be gibberish. The entries here are mostly incomplete thoughts; they probably won't useful for anyone else but me. Sorry you've stumbled upon this, but there is really nothing really to see here.

### Embedded Code Blocks

With syntax highlighting! How cool is that!

You can use [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) or generate your own with [Kate Hudson's Syntax Highlighting Theme Generator for Prism](http://k88hudson.github.io/syntax-highlighting-theme-generator/www/).

```js
import { useState, useContext } from "react"
import { ThemeContext } from "../../../components/Theme/index"
import styles from "./Note.module.css"

const Demonstration = () => {
    const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext)

    const isLight = theme === "light"

    return (
        <button
            type="button"
            className={isLight ? styles.isLight : styles.isDark}
            onClick={toggleTheme}
        >
            {isLight ? "🌙 Tap for 🌙 mode 🌙" : "🌼 Tap for 🌼 mode 🌼"}
        </button>
    )
}

export default Demonstration
```

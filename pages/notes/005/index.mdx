I've done something like this before in [my old robotics blog](https://mithi.github.io/robotics-blog/ideas/)
Where I list all the cool stuff that seems to be exciting to learn and build and explore.
I won't necessarily be able to accomplish these things, and that's okay.
This is again another brain dump I guess.

-   [ ] Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations
-   [ ] Underactuated Robotics
-   [ ] Hexapods Sprawling Quadrupeds
-   [ ] Robot Arms
-   [ ] Quadcopters
-   [ ] Mechanisms with Lego and 3d Printing

## Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

1. [ ] Create a simple visualizer of homogenous transforms, and 3d rotations converter with quaternions etc
2. [ ] [The Essence of linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) (finish all 3blue1brown videos)

    a. [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/0387982582) by Axler

    b. Maybe also build a couple of visualizers that illustrate linear algebra concepts

3. [ ] [Tyler Veness: Graduate-level control theory for high schoolers](https://github.com/calcmogul/controls-engineering-in-frc)

4. [ ] It would be interesting to revisit Newtonian Mechanics and Dynamics course back from freshman college

5. [ ] It's also interesting to study dynamics and control of a 3d pendulums and variations

    a. Simulation of 3d Simple pendulums and double pendulums

    b. Simulation of 3 Inverted pendulums etc

    c. Read papers about Nonlinear dynamics of a 3d pendulums, Dynamics and Control of a 3D Pendulum

6. [ ] Checkout some of the resources for the [prerequisites](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/Spring2020/resources.html) of the under actuated course particularly

    a. [Ordinary Differential Equations in Khan's Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)

    b. [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos by Strogatz](https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Dynamics-Chaos-Applications-Nonlinearity/dp/0738204536)

7. [ ] Try out underactuated robotics course [Russ Tedrake](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/Spring2020/) (atleast half)

## Robot Arm

1. [ ] Write a robot arm simulator that can be used to control a real robot arm [my real robot arm](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1128055363/7bot-a-powerful-desktop-robot-arm-for-future-inven)
       a. You should be able to control the robots end effector with your mouse
2. [ ] Use my robot arm simulator to control this [my robot arm](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1128055363/7bot-a-powerful-desktop-robot-arm-for-future-inven)

## Hexapod and Sprawling Quadrupeds

1. [ ] Build a hexapod robot from AliExpress with Arduino and a PS2 controller clone
2. [ ] Convert that hexapod to use Raspberry Pi instead
3. [ ] Use [my app](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod) to control that hexapod with [LocalXpose](https://localxpose.io/) from anywhere in the world with WIFI
4. [ ] Build 3d printed / lazercut robot with microservos - [Petar Crnjak](3D-printed-Hexapod) Code and STL files for small 18 servo hexapod
5. [ ] Write my own code to make a sprawling quadruped move the way I want

## Quadruped Dog

1. [ ] Study the papers, code, and articles by [Maurice Rahme](https://github.com/OpenQuadruped/spot_mini_mini) and [Adham Elarabawy](https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/open-quadruped)
2. [ ] Build a simple simulator of the quadruped like Adham Elarabawy did

## Quadcopters

1. [ ] Build a quadcopter simulator. Given a list of specified way points, generate a simulation of the quadcopter going from point to point using the minimum snap trajectory algorithm.

    a. not only should the state be displayed but also the control inputs (for each motor) among others

2. [ ] Build an actual quadcopter from the ground up that I will program from scratch

## Mechanisms, Lego and 3d printing

I've always found mechanisms interesting. Here's some of my favorite lego builders

1. [Akiyuki Kawaguchi's great ball contraptions](https://akiyuki.jp/en/)
2. [ISOGAWA Yoshihito](http://www.isogawastudio.co.jp/legostudio/toranomaki/en/)
3. [Paul Sariel](http://sariel.pl/) and his favorite lego builders

    a. [Jennifer Clark](http://www.genuinemodels.com/)

    b. [Nico 71](http://www.nico71.fr/)

4. [JK Brickworks](https://jkbrickworks.com/)

-   [ ] I hope I can also make time to make awesome stuff like them.
-   [ ] I've never really did a lot of CADWork like using Fusion360 or OnShape, and it's something
        I've always wanted to try.
-   [ ] I want to make adapters that I can 3d print so
        that I can use popular servo motors and other actuators (motors and stepers)
        work with lego.
-   [ ] There are also a lot of really cool open source mechanisms in thingiverse that you can 3d print.
        It would be really cool to 3d print them!

## Wishlist

I've already done [a wishlist before](https://mithi.github.io/robotics-blog/wish-list/)
Here's a short list

1. [ ] [A creality 3d printer](https://creality3d.shop/)
2. [ ] ALL [Unique Wooden Mechanical Models UGears Models ](https://ugearsmodels.com/)
3. [ ] Parts to build my own drone

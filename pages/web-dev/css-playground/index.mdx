## Overflow

<OverflowDiv />

```css
/* type OverflowType = "visible" | "hidden" | "clip" | "scroll" | "auto" */
div {
    overflow: auto;
}
```

## Float

### None

<FloatExample float="none" />

### Left

<FloatExample float="left" />

### Right

<FloatExample float="right" />

## Position

### static (default)

<PositionExample position="static" />

> Element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
> Top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.

### relative

<PositionExample position="relative" top="30px" left="50px" />

> The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document THEN offset relative to itself
> The offset does not affect the position of any other elements
> the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.

```css
div {
    position: relative;
    top: 30px;
    left: 50px;
}
```

When position is not set, then there is no offset

<PositionExample position="relative" />

### absolute

> The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.

In this case, the parent is positioned, the coordinates are set.

<PositionExample
    position="absolute"
    containerPosition="relative"
    top="40px"
    left="60px"
/>

```css
.parent {
    position: relative;
}

.child {
    position: absolute;
    top: 40px;
    left: 60px;
}
```

> IMPORTANT: Please make sure the coordinates are set, or there will be some unwanted unintended behavior like this:
> (scroll the example below)

<PositionExample position="absolute" containerPosition="static" />

```css
.parent {
    position: relative;
}

.child {
    position: absolute;
}
```

> It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor
> If unable to find a positioned parent, it positions itself relative to the body

### sticky

> The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document,
> and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block
> (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements.
> The offset does not affect the position of any other elements

<PositionExample position="sticky" top="0px" />

```css
.child {
    position: -webkit-sticky;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0px;
}
```

> First it is relative for a while, then it is fixed for a while, finally, it disappears from the view

For a detailed discussion of various cases: see also [stackoverflow: How does the “position: sticky;” property work?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43707076/how-does-the-position-sticky-property-work)

### fixed

> The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout
> It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors
> has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none,
> in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block

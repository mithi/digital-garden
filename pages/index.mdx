This is a place where I drop notes about things on my mind. The entries here are
mostly incomplete thoughts; they probably won't useful for anyone else but me. Sorry
you've stumbled upon this, but there is really nothing really to see here. You might
find my [Hexapod Robot Simulator](https://hexapod.netlify.app/), amusing though! Bye!

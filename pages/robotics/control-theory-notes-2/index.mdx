# Simulations

1. Free Simple pendulum 
2. Acrobot robot (free + control)
3. Inverted pendulum on a cart
4. Double pendulum on a cart
5. A 2d quadrotor, LQR
6. Simple trajectory planning of a 2d quadrotor
 
# Control Concepts

- [x] lyapunov stability theory
- [x] Phase portraits
- [x] Two lectures on Underactuated Robotics Youtube channel
- [x] Learned about 4th order - 4th order runge kutta
- [x] Equations of motion for
		- [x] Acrobots
		- [x] Simple Pendulum
		- [x]  Double Pendulum
		- [x]  Quadrotor2d
		- [x]  Inverted Cartpole
		- [x]  Inverted Double Pendulum on a cart
- [x] Linear Quadratic Regulators
- [x] Combining linear quadratic regulator and swing up control
- [x] The langrangian method, use euler-lagrange equation to get the equations of motions
- [x] Runge Kutta 4th order method -finds approximate value of y for a given x for first order ordinary differential equations
- [x] [Robotics preliminaries](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/multibody.html#section1) - Deriving the equations of motions and the manipulator equation form of the simple pendulum
- [x] [Chapter 4 Murray, Robot Dynamics and Control](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/MLS/pdf/mls94-manipdyn_v1_2.pdf) - Equations of motion for an open-chain manipulator
- [x] Please check openai gym classic implementations of control, there is also a simple implementation of 4th order Runge Kutta there.
- [x] [Matthew Peter Kelly](http://www.matthewpeterkelly.com/tutorials/index.html) Mathew Peter Kelly's tutorials looks great, I'm particularly interested in his Trajectory Optimization tutorials
